# CREATION PRAISING GOD

The beautiful world around us is crying out glory and honor and praise to our Creator. The birds, the stars, and the trees all worship Him by doing what they were created to do. Encourage your children to notice the beautiful world around us, introduce them to biblical language,  and train them that they, too, can worship God because He is worthy of all praise. 

“For ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can clearly see His invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God”.

—Romans 1:20 (NLT)
